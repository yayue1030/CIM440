Yayue Zheng Final Project CIM440

This is my project based on what I have learnt through the semester. The inspiration of this work mainly comes from the recent festival atmosphere. Every December, the atmosphere of the Christmas festival is everywhere, making the whole city especially lively. My project contains characters related to the Christmas and also interactions on some of the characters.  The target audience is children, because they have more expectations and enthusiasm for the festival. There are animated characters in my works, the purpose is to satisfy the childlike innocence of the children.


This is my final concept slide.
